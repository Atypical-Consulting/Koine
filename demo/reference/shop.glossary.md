## Legacy — version 1

Legacy bounded context — an external payment gateway whose model we do not control. Payments shields itself from it with an anti-corruption layer (R14.2).

### GatewayResult — value

The raw result the legacy gateway returns. Payments never references this directly — it goes through the generated translator interface.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rawReference | `String` |  |
| rawAmount | `Decimal` |  |

## Ordering — version 1

Ordering bounded context — placing and pricing customer orders.

### RefundStatus — enum

How far along a refund is. Shares the `Cancelled` member with OrderStatus — bare members resolve against the field/operand enum type (R3.5).

### OrderStatus — enum

The lifecycle state of an order.

Values: Draft, Submitted, Paid, Shipped, Cancelled

| currency | `Currency` |  |

**Business rules**
- an amount cannot be negative

### OrderPlaced — integration event

Announced to the rest of the system when an order is placed (R14.3). An integration event is a *published language* — its fields stay primitive (ids/scalars), never leaking internal value objects.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| orderId | `OrderId` |  |
| customer | `CustomerId` |  |
| total | `Decimal` |  |
| placedAt | `Instant` |  |

### Order — aggregate (root: Order)

The order aggregate. `versioned` adds an optimistic-concurrency token (R11.4); the `repository` block tunes the mutating set and adds intention-revealing finders (R11.3); being an aggregate it also joins the context `IUnitOfWork`.

#### OrderOpened — event

Raised when an order is opened by the factory (R6/R8).

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| orderId | `OrderId` |  |
| customer | `CustomerId` |  |
| lineCount | `Int` |  |

#### OrderSubmitted — event

Raised when an order is submitted for processing (R6).

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| orderId | `OrderId` |  |
| lineCount | `Int` |  |

#### OrderLine — value

One line of an order: a product, a quantity, and a unit price.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| product | `ProductId` |  |
| quantity | `Int` | How many units of the product. At least one. |
| unitPrice | `Money` |  |
| lineTotal | `Money` | _derived_ |
| payable | `Money` | _derived_ — What the customer actually pays for this line (10% off at 10+ units). |

**Business rules**
- an order line needs at least one unit

#### Order — entity

The order a customer places — the consistency boundary of this aggregate.

Identified by `OrderId`.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| customer | `CustomerId` |  |
| lines | `List<OrderLine>` |  |
| status | `OrderStatus` |  |
| refund | `RefundStatus` |  |
| submittedAt | `Instant?` |  |
| total | `Money` | _derived_ |
| lineCount | `Int` | _derived_ |
| isPlaced | `Bool` | _derived_ |
| isCancelled | `Bool` | _derived_ |
| isRefunded | `Bool` | _derived_ |

**Business rules**
- every line needs a positive quantity
- no duplicate products in an order
- status == Draft when lines.isEmpty

### Services

- **OrderingService** — R12.2 — the application/use-case service interface (IOrderingService). Each use case maps to one async method; a context with aggregates also gets a UoW.
